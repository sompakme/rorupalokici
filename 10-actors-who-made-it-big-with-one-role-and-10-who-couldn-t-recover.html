Several of the actors on our list were only moments away from retirement. Until they were given that one opportunity that turned everything around. This includes a prominent member of the Avengers who play a big part into why Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;may&nbsp;go down as the most successful&nbsp;movie of all-time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several other actors have hopefully paid their agents handsomely as they've kept these names in everyone's house for over a decade with multiple standout performances.&nbsp;Along with enjoying finding out about their breakout roles, we hope you also love the photos we've&nbsp;complied below, which show these stars at the start of their breakout role!</p><p>But Hollywood is not always such a kind place. And while the&nbsp;successful celebrities on our list may have made it look so easy, the opposite side will prove just how rocky the road can be to fame. They may have found success at one point in time, but that might make the bitter reality of the years that followed all the harder to endure. Like the&nbsp;successful photos, we've created photos of these celebrities from their time in the spotlight, as well as the - at times - shocking photos of how far they've fallen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These are the 10 Actors Who Made Their Career With One Role (And 10 Who Ruined Theirs)</p><h2 id=made-it-big---amy-adams-with-junebug><strong>Made it big - Amy Adams With Junebug</strong></h2><p>There are many tremendous movies that Amy Adams has been involved in. But did you know that it was one movie in particular that kept her in Hollywood? It was in 2005 when Adams was cast in the film, Junebug. While the film made under $4 million at the box office, Adams was recognized for her tremendous performance to the extent that she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. While she lost out to Rachel Weisz and her performance in The Constant Gardener, the experience still taught Adams a lot about herself.</p><p>When talking about her mindset prior to the film coming out, Adams stated,</p><p><strong>"I thought maybe I should move to New York, maybe I should do something else. It wasn't that I was quitting or making a dramatic statement. It was more like maybe this just wasn't a good fit. Maybe I should go refocus. And then at Sundance, everything shifted."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What Adams was referring to was that at the Sundance festival she earned recognition in the category of Special Jury Prize for Acting. Some of Adams biggest standouts since then include Enchanted and Arrival.
